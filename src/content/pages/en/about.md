title: "Just Sereja: About Me"
h1: Hi, I'm Just Sereja! 👋
description: A bit about me and why this blog exists.
---

Trying to find or create something cool on the internet or, occasionally, in real life. Just chasing some fun and whatever silly joke I can catch.

## What I Do

Diligently learning how to slack off and enjoy it. I want to master doing nothing and somehow extract the **prikol** from it.

## Connect With Me

Follow my socials, support me, drop a line if you have something to say. I'll be happy with any form of support.

*I seriously doubt that in 2025+ people still read websites, and I'm not counting on it. This blog is purely a personal stash of cool stuff I like one way or another. A little bit of personal space.*
